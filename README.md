My main idea at the beginning was to create a fake portfolio as if I was a game developer with some experience given to the web resume some background and showing some pictures/videos about making games.
Nevertheless I wish to give the web resume my face, using some dark colors and very nice dark style to the page.
Unfortunatelly I lost my laptop at the beginning of May/2020 and my enthusiast was lost also, even after I got my new laptop I was in some way frustraded and not close inspired to build a nive web resume as I was planned.
But, to make the ends meet with my grades and in respect to the Teacher I made this web resume, is not a fake like the main idea, but I tried to do at least the very basic and since I was almost 4 months without practice I would say that it is a avarage job, nothing greatfull or worth it of the Teacher, but due to my current situation it was the maximum that my will could do. And being very sincere I did not strive to do my best.
I did not use any external source to my code so there is no referencing here, i just used the knowledge that I could remember.
